        My name is Derek Helgoe. I'm a current student in the full stack development program through the University of Minnesota. I reside in the twin cities. Outside of coding and learning I like to enjoy the warm weather outdoors, sports and video games with friends. This application is still in early development as more design, links/photos will be added before the final product is finished!
